 * AI Prediction documentation
 * 
 * 
 * The Prediction Dialog is a dialog box used to display 
 * an AI-generated prediction regarding the weather's suitability
 * for tennis training. 
 * It is powered by the PredictionCubit to manage states 
 * related to making and displaying the prediction.

Key Components:
WeatherEntity: The dialog receives a WeatherEntity object, which contains 
weather details and is passed to the prediction logic to generate
 the AI prediction.

PredictionCubit: This is the main cubit handling the state of 
the prediction process, which includes triggering the AI prediction 
and managing different states: loading, loaded, error, and initial.

AlertDialog: The prediction results are displayed inside an AlertDialog,
 which has a title and content that changes dynamically 
 based on the current state of the PredictionCubit.

State Handling:
PredictionLoading:

A spinner is displayed when the prediction is in progress.
PredictionLoaded:

When the prediction is complete, a message is shown based on the prediction result.
If the prediction value is 1,
 the dialog displays a message indicating that the weather is great for tennis: "The weather is great! You can train for tennis today."
If the prediction value is not suitable, 
it shows: "Sorry, the weather isnâ€™t suitable for tennis today."


PredictionError:
If there is an error in generating the prediction, 
the error message is displayed in red text.

Fallback:
In any unexpected state, it shows a fallback message: "No prediction made yet."
 
Example Scenario:
When a user opens the PredictionDialog after receiving weather data,
 the app makes an AI-based prediction about whether the weather 
 is suitable for tennis. The dialog updates dynamically based on 
 the AI's prediction, showing either a positive or negative message, 
 or handling potential errors.
