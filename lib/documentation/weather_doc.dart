/*
*This WeatherScreen is a detailed weather display for a given city, 
utilizing the WeatherCubit to fetch and display weather data.
 It features a visually appealing layout with weather conditions shown in a grid, 
and it also gracefully handles loading states and potential errors.

* BlocProvider: The WeatherCubit is provided using GetIt for dependency injection, and it's initialized 
to fetch the weather data for the given city when the screen is built.

BlocBuilder: This is used to manage the UI based on the current state of the WeatherCubit. It handles different states:

*WeatherLoading: Displays a loading spinner and a "Loading data..." message.
*WeatherLoaded: Displays weather data in a grid layout, 
including temperature, wind speed, humidity, visibility, and weather condition.
*WeatherError: Displays an error message if there is a problem fetching the data.


*WeatherDetailItem: A reusable widget for displaying a specific weather detail (e.g., temperature, wind speed).
 It contains an icon, a label, and the value for the weather parameter.

Example Use Case:
When a user searches for weather in a specific city, 
they are taken to this WeatherScreen. If the city is valid
 and the weather API responds, they will see detailed weather information; otherwise,
 they will receive an appropriate error message.
